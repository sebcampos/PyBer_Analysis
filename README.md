# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Using the Data provided by V. Isualize we created a ride sharing summary DataFrame organized by city type. Then utilizing the matplotlib library and the functions provided by matplotlib.pyplot we rendered charts and graphs to highlight and illustrate the data in a way that is easier to digest

## Results

### Dataframe based on city type

### Line graph based on total fares by city type

When comparing the Rural, Suburban and Urban values we can see that Urban citites have the largest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares followed by Suburban and finnaly Rural cities. But when we compare the average fare per ride and average fare per driver we see the opposite. Rural cities holding the highest values followed by Suburban and then Urban. This is due possibly to the logic that because the larger cities (Urban) have a larger amount of potential drivers only moving short distances within the city the average fare would be smaller. On the other hand a rural driver may be taking more trips to and from the suburban,urban areas covering more distance therefore accumulating a larger number of Average Fare per Driver.
